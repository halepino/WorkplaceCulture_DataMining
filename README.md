# WorkplaceCulture_DataMining  

### Repo Contents
Repo contains dataset and associate files for personal project proposed for DataMining550 course compeltion in the MS Data Science Program @ Bellevue University  

### Objective: 
Project aims to inform company practices/offerings that reduce work-interference due to employee mental health through aid of machine learning and analysis of feature importance. A decision tree classifier was used to predict work interference and once a model was optimized, feature importance was analyzed to highlight workplace culture traits associated with increased or decreased work-interference. The major challenge was to create a predicting model based only on features that reflected employee information that was ethically and realistically available to an employer. Features related to protected statuses (race,sex, orientation etc) were also dropped.
